# Hatsune-Miku-Virtual-Universe
The Hatsune Miku web built with Vue.js features a home page, concerts, gallery, merch, news, fan art, and a wishlist. Users can upload their own fan art, browse Miku outfits in the gallery, read articles in the news section, and add concerts or shop items to their wishlist. The site includes filtering, sorting, and a modern responsive design.
